Call upon this card when you feel you are going through a change, to create change, or to move towards the life you want to live. Shifting into the unknown can be hard, and this is a reminder to trust in yourself. Change is an active process to embrace. <br>

In the wise words of Octavia E. Butler “All that you touch you change. All that you change changes you. The only lasting truth is change. God is change.”
