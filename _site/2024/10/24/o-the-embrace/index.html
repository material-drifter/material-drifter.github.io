<p>Sprinkled in sweet songs 
and the defiant calls of loud living 
In sidewalks cracks filled with long green stalks 
spelling out the subtle strengths that have 
covered these landscapes for ages</p>

<p>In the soft snooze that comes with 
familiar entanglements
under hand stitched blankets 
with tv fuzz filling the air
spinning in two wheels with wind swept hair</p>

<p>This pours out of sleepy coffee cups 
you make me in the morning 
stirred in the chili pot that always has 
room for seconds</p>

<p>It’s the shoulder in the night
dancing in the dark
howls 
that sing magic into 
breaths of life 
that keep hope in these veins 
and a thirst to keep going</p>
