<p>I do not need to tell them to breath 
(they know) 
(it is them bringing me back home) 
and still, I lift pipes cast upon them
forged in possession, time pumping faster 
I look to clenching hands to ask, 
can you feel 
scarcity breeding scarcity?</p>

<p>I turn to them again 
the mender 
stitching themselves into decay 
seeding circles.</p>

<p>And I too, stitch my fingers in
lifting out despair, rooted invasion 
Pulling nets from homes choked<br />
	hurtling towards collapse 
This tending takes its time 
	as you cannot rush the seasons.</p>

<p>And with their room to rest 
I can feel it too 
our bodies bound together 
wrapped in the echoes of our future 
   endless spools of connection 
our many ways,  woven into maps.</p>
