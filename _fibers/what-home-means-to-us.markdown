*2023-2025, Kentucky* <br>
<br>
Hosted by Annette Hines and Kat Smith of [KY Tenants](https://www.kytenants.org), *What Home Means to Us* is a 6 part quilt project building off 2 community quilt workshops held in 2023. This workshop series aims to engage participants in Kentucky about housing through education, conversation, and the creation of a community quilt. <br>
The 6 part series kicked off in September of 2024, touring central and eastern KY. In each workshop while participants learn about community land trusts, land trust models that already exist, and the one currently being created in Eastern KY, each person creates their own quilt block about what home means to them. Each quilt square is backed on fabric dyed with indigo or goldenrod, and basic design techniques are demoed. Once complete, the final quilt will be shown at the [Kentucky Folk Art Center](https://www.moreheadstate.edu/academics/colleges/humanities/kentucky-folk-art-center/) in Morehead, KY.
