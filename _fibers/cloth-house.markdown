*2017, Lexington, KY*<br>
<br>
*Cloth House* explores thoughts on home making, traditionally female labor, and the often unrecognized power of vulnerability.<br>
This piece includes fabrics hand dyed with herbs, and explores material resistance through the cloth itself + process of construction. Hidden messages are embroidered throughout.
