*2018, Lexington KY* <br>
<br>

Begun in 2013 and inspired by the *Names Project* (the AIDS Quilt), The *Monument Quilt* is an on-going collection of stories from survivors of rape and abuse. Written, stitched, and painted onto red fabric, our stories are displayed in city, and town centers to create and demand public space to heal. The quilt resists the popular and narrow narrative of how sexual violence occurs by telling many stories, not one. The quilt builds a new culture where survivors are publicly supported, rather than publicly shamed. This project culminated in a display on the National Mall in Washington, DC in Spring 2019. This project was created by Baltimore-based survivor collective [FORCE: Upsetting Rape Culture](https://upsettingrapeculture.com).<br>
<br>
In the spring of 2018, 3 artists came together to hold 2 workshops at the U.K. SAVS building. These workshops created the opportunity for people in Lexington to make their own quilt square to be added to the National Monument Quilt.<br>
