Just as quilts are care objects that hold many people, coming into queer identity can be held by many hands. *Many Part of a not-so-lonesome Star* reflects rural queer experience, kinship with the natural world, and finding ourselves through the collective. Contained within this piece is revisited memories of growing up with an ever present community of critters in an otherwise lonesome area. How a young self can find themselves through creek water ripples, tree rings, and sitting with the neighbor cows. Who we love or how we feel are not a problem to the grass we lay on. This quilt brings in time honored elements of quilting, while expanding, changing, and playing with the tradition.
