*2020, Lexington KY* <br>
*boots, dirt, string* <br>
Created as a reflection at the onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic. <br>
<br>
In our current state when motion is restricted, how do you feel movement? When chaos feels close with less space to turn, how do you feel stillness? As our world weighs on suspension, I find these two folding into each other, working their ways as one. <br>
<br>
As our world weighs on suspension, what moves you to groundedness? How do you feel the subtle opening and closing? Ripples that run through? Expansion, contractions? I turn to dirt and water- those that can sit so still, and move so much. <br>
