#### Kat Smith (they/them)
is a queer multi-media artist born and raised in Central Kentucky.

Their creative practice mostly manifests through fibers, printmaking, zines, and film photography, often melding these materials together.
Their work draws on the natural landscape around them, home, sense of place, ritual, reflection, dreams, gender, communal practice, and liberatory lineages.

They currently are a member of the artist collective: [*Solarpunk Surf Club*](https://www.solarpunksurf.club)

When they arenâ€™t making visual art you can find them moving on the dancefloor, growing in the garden, making herbal medicines, on the road, at the circus, or spending time in Kentucky's many pockets of DIY community.
