*The Nature Sanctuary of Dreams and Mirrors* <br>
*2022, Lexington KY* <br>
<br>
A dream can be seeded in the smallest of moments. Stirring just below the surface, these subtle movements build momentum, bringing our visions ever forward into the light.<br>
<br>
Part performance, part art gallery, part outreach and part ritual, this project came together as an afternoon spent at McConnell Springs Park in Lexington, KY in 2021. Participants were invited to use this space to reflect on how they envision the future they want to see, both individually and collectively.<br>
<br>
Participants received the dream reflection worksheet and were encouraged to use the dream walk, a nature path consisting of a visual art piece, to explore the questions. After writing down their thoughts they could then venture over to a recording station to speak their dreams into the universe. This practice was paired with a Future Visioning Yoga Session led by Christina Lynch and was hosted by The Muzineum. <br>
<br>
In 2022 a zine release event was held at the Loudon House Gallery in Lexington, KY. <br>
