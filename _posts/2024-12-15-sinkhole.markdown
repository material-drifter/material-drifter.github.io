clouds of dust <br>
rise through <br>
afternoon light <br>
blown rock tubing below <br>
a scramble <br>
to fill what's yet again been swallowed <br>

sounds of Komatsu's claw <br>
rolling the rubble <br>
carries me to lines of <br>
steel cast veins <br>
poisoned blood <br>
human accelerations <br>
that lay the promise of <br>
scorched landscapes <br>
and coughing babies <br>
dressed by the shadowed lips of <br>
'keeping the lights on' <br>
<br>
a slow sink <br>
characteristic of this land <br>
patient exhales of rock <br>
through percolating water <br>
now, angered and weighted by the <br>
thick sludge of gluttony <br>
hoarded and distant from <br>
the valley of dissolution <br>
<br>
cavities cry the inevitable collapse <br>
amplified more by our singing sisters <br>
how sweet their sound <br>
blinded now, will hungry hands finally choose to see? <br>
