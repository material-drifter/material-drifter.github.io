do you ever see morning light <br>
hit branches in the breeze <br>
and know it is enough? <br>
yes, and often, it's all I needed <br>
<br>
and do you ever suck in crisp cold air <br>
just to have it taken away? <br>
yes, and often, it gives itself back <br>
in ways <br>
warmer than before <br>
<br>
I bow my deep bow <br>
kissing soil with sight <br>
hearing its call <br>
to keep coming back <br>
choosing Yes to this field <br>
and the next <br>
arms <br>
stretched and wide open <br>
