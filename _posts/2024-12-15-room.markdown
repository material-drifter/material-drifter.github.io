as I think back to those days <br>
I find you in cloudy desire <br>
floating in the door frame <br>
<br>
untouched, yet <br>
by the warmth of your embrace <br>
untouched, yet <br>
ripples beginning <br>
<br>
its funny to find you <br>
in the tongue <br>
of those once forgotten moments <br>
so small, they were, back then <br>
<br>
there is something to, <br>
seeing yourself <br>
there is something to, <br>
seeing yourself in the eyes of others <br>
beaming back <br>
