I count my seven coins <br>
perked to the clink of <br>
metal hitting metal <br>
<br>
the sound of <br>
turned soil <br>
sweat on the brow <br>
movement stirring below surfaces, unseen <br>
I guess this is how dreams work <br>
<br>
patience sitting in the back room <br>
hands turned skyward <br>
gaze to the ground <br>
the strong ache <br>
the stars in my eyes <br>
glinting only for those who look <br>
visions toiled and tended <br>
I guess this is how dreams persist <br>
<br>
the honeyed taste of peach <br>
dribbling chin <br>
this moment, conceived long before <br>
knowing nothing but <br>
the tenderhearted hands <br>
light dancing, through open windows <br>
invites the surrender <br>
to the warm bath of promise <br>
