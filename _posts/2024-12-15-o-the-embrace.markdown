sprinkled in sweet songs <br>
and the defiant calls of loud living <br>
in sidewalks cracks filled with long green stalks <br>
spelling out the subtle strengths that have <br>
covered these landscapes for ages <br>
<br>
in the soft snooze that comes with <br>
familiar entanglements <br>
under hand stitched blankets <br>
with tv fuzz filling the air <br>
spinning in two wheels with wind swept hair <br>
<br>
this pours out of sleepy coffee cups <br>
you make me in the morning <br>
stirred in the chili pot that always has <br>
room for seconds <br>
<br>
itâ€™s the shoulder in the night <br>
dancing in the dark <br>
howls <br>
that sing magic into <br>
breaths of life <br>
that keep hope in these veins <br>
and a thirst to keep going <br>
