I open the door to <br>
sun and cold and wind <br>
to lives held in the homes I pass <br>
dreaming up my own in each <br>
to cunching leaves <br>
and dogs that bark <br>
the church bell tolling <br>
through distant trees <br>
exacting counts of movements <br>
in a day <br>
sweet and familiar and pulling me out <br>
like rail whistles <br>
and birdsongs <br>
