in this one, I see you in new light <br>
beams breaking past folding waves <br>
silhouetted by all the untold stories <br>
ones that dance to calmer tides <br>
and seldom fall to infinite repetition <br>
<br>
in this one, is the one I crave <br>
take me to the backroads of your life <br>
to old lovers, and book marked pages <br>
moments held quietly <br>
kept in close pockets on longer days <br>
<br>
in this one, I check the back for <br>
Time, Place <br>
anything to trace me back to *this* you <br>
to unworried feet in the sand <br>
wispy and breeze blown <br>
to the universe of you that I want to remember <br>
