Held by the hand of <br>
fresh fallen leaves <br>
sun kissed in color by <br>
the turning of air <br>
<br>
I walk these hollows <br>
to the humdrum of the katydid <br>
to rushing water, moving me still <br>
<br>
The harsh hand of judgement <br>
does not know these paths <br>
trees standing <br>
as they are <br>
