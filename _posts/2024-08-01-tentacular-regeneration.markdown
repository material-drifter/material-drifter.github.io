I do not need to tell them to breath <br>
(they know) <br>
(it is them bringing me back home) <br>
and still, we lift pipes cast upon them <br>
forged in possession, time pumping faster <br>
I look to clenching hands to ask, <br>
can you feel <br>
scarcity breeding scarcity? <br>
<br>
I turn to them again <br>
the mender <br>
stitching themselves into decay <br>
seeding circles <br>
<br>
and I too, stitch my fingers in <br>
lifting out despair, rooted invasion <br>
Pulling nets from homes choked <br>
	hurtling towards collapse <br>
This tending takes its time <br>
	as you cannot rush the seasons <br>
<br>
and with their room to rest <br>
I can feel it too <br>
our bodies bound together <br>
wrapped in the echoes of our future <br>
   endless spools of connection <br>
our many ways,  woven into maps <br>
