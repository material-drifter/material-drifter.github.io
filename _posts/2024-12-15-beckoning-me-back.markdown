Hands finger blades of wheat 
as it sways away and back to. 
A thumbing that allows for a 
brief pause of thought. 
To slowly pace back from the steady stream of 
clothes to mend 
grain to mill
babies to feed. 
A crying beckons me back. 
My sauntering gains momentum as 
thistles grab at my apron, calling 
just a moments longer to take. 

Back at the house 
with hens dreaming through midday heat
I find Mrs. Henson's son yet again 
hanging around
untroubled by my lack of interest. 
as he rambles on, as he usually does
all I can think of is where his sweet sister Carolyn is
and why she can't be 
the one 
doing the bidding.
