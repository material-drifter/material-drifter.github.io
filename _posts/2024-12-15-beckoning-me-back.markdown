hands finger blades of wheat <br>
as it sways away and back to <br>
a thumbing that allows for a <br>
brief pause of thought <br>
to slowly pace back from the steady stream of <br>
clothes to mend <br>
grain to mill <br>
babies to feed <br>
a crying beckons me back <br>
my sauntering gains momentum as <br>
thistles grab at my apron, calling <br>
just a moments longer to take <br>
<br>
back at the house <br>
with hens dreaming through midday heat <br>
I find Mrs. Henson's son yet again <br>
hanging around <br>
untroubled by my lack of interest <br>
as he rambles on, as he usually does <br>
all I can think of is where his sweet sister Carolyn is <br>
and why she can't be <br>
the one <br>
doing the bidding
