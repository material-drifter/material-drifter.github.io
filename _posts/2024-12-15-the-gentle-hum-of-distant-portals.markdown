bloodstained and screaming <br>
unknowing <br>
of sparks ignited in the flames of birth <br>
the path lain in ash <br>
conjured and carried by the belly of <br>
divine alignment <br>
<br>
to dream up the future and walk <br>
backwards in the night <br>
tracing your hands <br>
with the illumination of all the strings <br>
placed at your feet <br>
<br>
reveling in the faces we've always known <br>
gifts given upon entry and waiting for your call <br>
<br>
to feel the ripples bounding towards you <br>
unafraid of the embrace <br>
guzzling the cup as beads roll <br>
the surface of skin <br>
grasping for the current to carry you under <br>
<br>
tethered to movements that propel us <br>
ever forward <br>
into the continual rotations <br>
of morning light <br>
whispered always by the quiet and knowing tide
