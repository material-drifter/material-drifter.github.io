you came to me in a dream <br>
sick was I, with a belly of twins <br>
not yet ready <br>
to find their way in the world <br>
I, not yet ready <br>
to lead them on their way <br>
<br>
two years pass <br>
the first, birthed and alive <br>
and I am crying as the light hits your hair <br>
standing amongst tall grasses blowing in the wind <br>
with so much stillness, and so much motion <br>
this moment is everything <br>
<br>
and you tell me your name <br>
and it is [Isis](https://egyptianmuseum.org/deities-isis) <br>
and I know I must remember you <br>
<br>
with this <br>
there is so much sweetness <br>
as you look into my eyes <br>
letting yourself go into the ether <br>
knowing, there are other beings to be born <br>
<br>
with this <br>
room to open<br>
the second one arrives <br>
bringing forth <br>
more dreams to feed <br>
