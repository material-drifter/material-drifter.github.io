I Thank the longest night, shortest day <br>
the wax of dark <br>
shifts opening room to new light <br>
new sun <br>
new hope in cold quiet days I'm growing warming to <br>
<br>
how long do movements take? <br>
the slow steady dance <br>
plies in sky <br>
stretched through six months time <br>
moments caught in the minutes of days <br>
in carves time for luminary dreams <br>
I too will rest these open eyes <br>
<br>
burrowed in the nest of still dark <br>
hollows to wonder <br>
parts of the whole <br>
the wheel finding its familiar rhythms <br>
pulled by new wind, dust stirred <br>
<br>
curtains drawn <br>
paper peeled back <br>
look to see what's been painted of the past <br>
see, time stamps gone <br>
see, bounty <br>
in all the futures we may hold <br>
<br>
fruits seeded <br>
in the minutes of days <br>
lain in damp soil <br>
wishes on a star <br>
I Thank you <br>
longest night, shortest day
